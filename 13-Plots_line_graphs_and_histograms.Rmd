```

In this chapter we will learn how to create two different types of plots; Histograms and Line graphs. I have chosen these two types of plots first as they are relatively straightforward to create.

Create and use the directory "Chapter_13-16" as the working directory for this chapter. Additionally create a new script called "Histograms_n_line_graphs.R" for this chapter.

## Histogram
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/histogram.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
A histogram consists of bars showing the frequency of variables present in numbered ranges (bins). This allows you to see an approximate distribution of numerical data.

We are starting with histograms as the __function__ `hist()`, which creates a histogram, only requires one __vector__. 

The following code creates a numerical __vector__ and then produces a histogram. When you run the `hist()` command a plot should appear in your __"Plots" pane__ of the __MISC window__.

```{r eval=FALSE}
numeric_vec <- 1:40
hist(numeric_vec)
``` 

You will notice that the histogram is not very interesting. There are 8 bars all of equal size. This is because we plotted the numbers from 1-40 so numbers 1-5 are counted in the first bar/bin, 6-10 in the second bar/bin and so forth. To get a more interesting histogram we will create a more interesting __vector__.

Histograms are good to see the numerical distribution of data. In this case we are going to look at the number of cities (with greater than 300,000 population) in EU countries (https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_European_Union_by_population_within_city_limits).

The first step is to create a __vector__ with the numbers of cities in EU countries, however we won't know what countries these correspond to yet. Then we will create a histogram and set the colour of the bars with the option `col = `.
```{r eval=FALSE}
eu_cities <- c(1, 1, 3, 1, 2,
               2, 1, 1, 6, 22,
               2, 1, 1, 10, 1,
               1, 4, 9, 1, 7,
               1, 12, 3)
hist(eu_cities, col = "orange")
```

With that histogram we can see that most EU countries have 1-5 cities with a few having a much larger amount. As most of the time you will not be working with just __vectors__ let us make a __data frame__ containing the number of EU cities and the population of the EU countries.

The population numbers will be in millions to the closest 1 decimal place and consist of the 2020 Eurostat figures from: https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_population

```{r eval=FALSE}
eu_country_names <- c("Austria", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Czech Republic", 
                      "Denmark", "Estonia", "Finland", "France", "Germany", 
                      "Greece", "Hungary", "Ireland", "Italy", "Latvia", 
                      "Lithuania", "Netherlands", "Poland", "Portugal", "Romania", 
                      "Slovakia", "Spain", "Sweden")
eu_pop <- c(8.9, 11.5, 7.0, 4.1, 10.7,
            5.8, 1.3, 5.5, 67.1, 83.2,
            10.7, 9.8, 5.0, 60.2, 1.9,
            2.8, 17.4, 38.0, 10.3, 19.3,
            5.5, 47.3, 10.3)
eu_df <- data.frame(eu_cities,eu_pop,
                    row.names = eu_country_names)
```

We will quickly create a histogram for the population numbers. We'll make the bar colours purple and we'll make the x axis label "2020 Eurostat population number in millions" with the `xlab = ` option.

```{r eval=FALSE}
hist(eu_df$eu_pop, col = "purple",
     xlab = "2020 Eurostat population number in millions")
```

We have a similar pattern as with the number of cities (most have low numbers, some high numbers). 

We can quickly check if the countries with the high number of cities also have the high populations by creating a new column equal to population / number of cities. This will give us nice ratios. We can plot the distribution of these ratios in a histogram.

For this histogram we will also add a title to the plot with the option `main = `. Additionally we will choose a different colour. Having different colours and main titles makes it easier for you to instantly know which plot you are looking at.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create ratio column
eu_df$pop_cities_ratio <- eu_df$eu_pop / eu_df$eu_cities
#Histogram of ratio distribution
hist(eu_df$pop_cities_ratio, col = "blue",
     xlab = "Ratio of population (millions) to numer of cities",
     main = "EU countries ratio of population to cities")
```

Looking at the plot most countries seem to have a ratio of 2-6 million citizens to every city. However, it is still not a perfect match with some lower and some higher ratios. Of course a result is a result and we have hopefully found out something new.

Before we go onto line graphs I'll show you how to look at your previous plots. In the __Plots pane__ of the __MISC window__ there are two arrows on the top left. You can use these to go backwards and forwards between the plots you have created since you opened RStudio. Give it a go!

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '40%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/RStudio_plot_pane_arrows.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Line graphs
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/line_graph.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
Line graphs are perfect for showing change over time. Knowing this we'll go back to a data set we have touched before, the file "honey_bee.tsv" from Chapter 8. This file showed the number of Honey Bee colonies in various US states from 2015-2018.

### Read in data
First step is to __read__ in the data from the "Chapter_8_files" directory. Once the __data frame__ is created we will remove all non 2017 & 2018 information.

__Note__: The `../` below represents going up one directory. I.e. going up from your current working directory ("Chapter_13-16") to the main directory so it can be directed to "Chapter_8_files".

```{r eval=FALSE}
bee_colonies_df <- read.csv("../Chapter_8_files/honey_bee.tsv", 
                            sep = "\t", row.names = 1, check.names = FALSE)
bee_colonies_2017_2018_df <- bee_colonies_df[9:16,]
```

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#For my testing
bee_colonies_df <- read.csv("honey_bee.tsv", sep = "\t", row.names = 1, check.names = FALSE)
bee_colonies_df <- bee_colonies_df[9:16,]
```

Before we continue have a look at the __data frame__ and make sure you are comfortable with what it contains. 

### Plotting a line graph
We are going to plot the entire information for the state of Minnesota. We will use the __function__ `plot()` with the option `type = "l"`. This will produce a plot of type "line" (`"l"`).

This requires we provide a numeric __vector__ for the x axis (option `x = `) and the y axis (option `y = `). Currently our quarter and year information is in the row names as strings. 

Therefore before we plot the information we will create a new column called "time_point" with the numbers 1 to the number of rows. We will carry this out with the __function__ `nrow()` which produces one number equal to the number of rows in the specified __data frame__. 

We won't use it here but the __function__ `ncol()` is similar to `nrow()` but for the number of columns.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Produce time_point column
bee_colonies_df$time_point <- 1:(nrow(bee_colonies_df))
#Produce line plot of Minnesota over time point.
plot(y = bee_colonies_df$Minnesota, bee_colonies_df$time_point, type = "l")
```

### Adding lines to a plot
This is looking decent but you normally want more than one line in a line graph. Thankfully we can do this with the __function__ `lines()`. We can add the other three states to the line graph like below:

__Tip__: Remember to use tab completion to auto fill __function__, __variable__, and column names as well as for __function__ options.
```{r eval=FALSE}
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Montana, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$`New Mexico`, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Pennsylvania, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
```

We have created the line graph with all the states However all the data is not visible.

### Axis limits
To fix this we need to make sure all the data is within the graph. When the `plot()` __function__ was run it created the y limits based on Minnesota which has a minimum and maximum value of 136000 and 27000. Unfortunately the other some other states barely fit in this range.

To prevent this issue we can use the `plot()` option of `ylim = `. This option is provided with a __vector__ of 2 numbers. The first number is where the y axis will start. The second number is where the y axis will end.

To find out where the y axis will end we will use the `max()` __function__. This will give one number which is equal to the highest number found in a numeric __object__. This __object__ can be a __scalar__, __vector__, or a __data frame__.

We will use the __function__ `min()` just like `max()` to find where the y axis should start.

Let us therefore recreate the plot with an appropriate y axis range.

__Note__: Some times it is more appropriate to set values for the y limits (i.e. starting the y axis at 0).

__Tip__: Copying your past code in the script editor and editing it will make the following examples a lot quicker to carry out.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Minimum and maximum for y axis
#Provide the function a subset of the bee_colonies_df
#so it is not using the time_point column
min_y <- min(bee_colonies_df[,1:4])
max_y <- max(bee_colonies_df[,-5])
#Produce line plot of Minnesota over time point.
#Set y limits (min,max)
plot(y = bee_colonies_df$Minnesota, bee_colonies_df$time_point, type = "l",
     ylim = c(min_y,max_y))
#Add lines
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Montana, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$`New Mexico`, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Pennsylvania, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
```

Great! That is much better. We can now see that two lines fall after time_point 2 whilst one increases. 

### Axis labels
Numbers on the x axis are not ideal in this case. We will therefore use the `axis()` function to set our own x axis labels. We will use the following options for this:

- `1`: The first option to `axis()` indicates the location of the axis labels. `1` indicates they will be located on the x axis (below).
- `at = bee_colonies_df$time_point`: This indicates where the points tic marks will be drawn.
- `labels = row.names(bee_colonies_df)`: A character __vector__ for the labels to be placed at the tick marks.

For more info for `axis()` run the command `?axis` to see its help page.

To use the `axis()` __function__ correctly we need to make sure there are no preexisting labels and tick marks on the x axis or else the new labels will go on top of the old. To do this we provide the `plot()` __function__ with the option `xaxt ='n'`, i.e. no x axis ticks.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Produce line plot of Minnesota over time point.
#Ensure x axis ticks and labels are not displayed
plot(y = bee_colonies_df$Minnesota, bee_colonies_df$time_point, type = "l",
     ylim = c(min_y,max_y), xaxt = 'n')
#Add row names (year and quarter strings) as x axix labels
axis(1, at = bee_colonies_df$time_point, labels = row.names(bee_colonies_df))
#Add lines
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Montana, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$`New Mexico`, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Pennsylvania, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
```

When the plot is generated there may be only some labels showing for the x axis. If you would like to show them all increase the size of the __MISC window__.

### Plot titles
Before we colour the lines different colours, let us add a main title and provide the x and y axis with better titles.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Produce line plot of Minnesota over time point.
#Add main, x, and y titles
plot(y = bee_colonies_df$Minnesota, bee_colonies_df$time_point, type = "l",
     ylim = c(min_y,max_y), xaxt = 'n',
     main = "Number of Honey Bee colonies in 4 US states over 2017 & 2018",
     ylab = "Bee colonies",
     xlab = "Year and Quarter")
#Add row names (year and quarter strings) as x axix labels
axis(1, at = bee_colonies_df$time_point, labels = row.names(bee_colonies_df))
#Add lines
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Montana, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$`New Mexico`, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Pennsylvania, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point)
```

### Line colours
Next we will colour the lines differently to differentiate the states. We carry this out with the `col = ` options for `plot()` and `lines()`.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Produce line plot of Minnesota over time point.
#Include the colour red for the bars
plot(y = bee_colonies_df$Minnesota, bee_colonies_df$time_point, type = "l",
     ylim = c(min_y,max_y), xaxt = 'n',
     main = "Number of Honey Bee colonies in 4 US states over 2017 & 2018",
     ylab = "Bee colonies",
     xlab = "Year and Quarter",
     col = "red")
#Add row names (year and quarter strings) as x axix labels
axis(1, at = bee_colonies_df$time_point, labels = row.names(bee_colonies_df))
#Add lines with different colours
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Montana, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point, col = "blue")
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$`New Mexico`, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point, col = "green")
lines(y = bee_colonies_df$Pennsylvania, x = bee_colonies_df$time_point, col = "purple")
```

### Plot legend
We are almost there! The one thing we are missing now is a legend so we can quickly see what colour represents each state.

This can be carried out by using the __function__ `legend()` after the plot is created. In this case the __function__ is run with the following options:

- `x = "topleft"`: The legend will be placed in the top left of the plot.
- `legend = colnames(bee_colonies_df[,1:4])`: This dictates the labels that will be in the legend.
- `col = c("red","blue","green","purple")`: This indicates the matching colours for the labels.
- `lty = 1`: This indicates that the colours will be presented as lines of type 1.

```{r eval=FALSE}
legend(x = "topleft",
       legend = colnames(bee_colonies_df[,1:4]),
       col = c("red","blue","green","purple"),
       lty = 1)
```

That is a good amount to go through. The next chapter will go into scatter plots and box plots. If you have time read through the above again and possibly try to create a histogram or line plot with one of the data sets from previous chapters.
