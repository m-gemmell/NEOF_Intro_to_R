# Files exercises
This exercise will look at two files. You will be assigned tasks requiring you to __read__ and __write__ files as well as index __data frames__.

Use your __"Exercises.R"__ file, ensuring you are using code sections to separate the different exercises. Additionally, set your working directory to your main workshop directory.

Create a new directory called "Chapter_8_files" within your main workshop directory to download the files [bat_roosts.csv](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_j4c0xh/downloads/bat_roosts.csv) & [UK_retail.tsv](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_j4c0xh/downloads/UK_retail.tsv).

As the files we are going to __read__ are in a different directory to our working directory we will have to specify the directory along with the file names. For example, to read in the "Liverpool_beaches.csv" file from the main directory you could use the  following command.

```{r eval=FALSE}
liv_beaches_df <- read.csv("Chapter_7/Liverpool_beaches.csv", row.names = 1)
```

Ensure you also __write__ any output to "Chapter_8_files".

## Bats
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/bat.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

First we will look at the file [bat_roosts.csv](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_j4c0xh/downloads/bat_roosts.csv). This contains information on the max number of roosts for different Bat species in different UK regions. 

The data is from: "Bat Conservation Trust 2020. Roost Count peak counts summary data". Available from https://www.bats.org.uk/our-work/national-bat-monitoring-programme/reports/nbmp-annual-report

For this file carry out the below tasks:

1. __Read__ in the file "bat_roosts.csv" as a __data frame__ __variable__ called "bat_df". Ensure the row names contain the Regions (Channel Islands, East Midlands, etc.).
2. Inspect the __variable__ and ensure there are only numerics within the __data frame__ with all strings only being in column and row names.
3. Add a row to "bat_df" called "UK" that contains the totals for each Species.
4. Add a column to "bat_df" called "All_Bat_Species" that contains the totals for each Region.
5. Create a transposed __data frame__ of "bat_df" called "bat_t_df".
6. __Write__ the __data frame__ "bat_t_df" to a comma separated file called "bat_roosts_t.csv". Ensure there are no quotes surrounding the row or column names.

Now that you have carried that out, attempt following MCQs using the "bat_t_df" object.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="Channel Islands", "North West", "Wales")
```
1. Which region has no roosts? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("Channel Islands", answer="North West", "Wales")
```
2. Which region has the largest amount of _Myotis brandtii_ roosts (excluding UK)? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("Pipistrellus nathusii", answer="Pipistrellus pygmaeus", "Rhinolophus hipposideros")
```
3. Which Bat species has the highest number of roosts across the UK? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="Pipistrellus nathusii", "Pipistrellus pygmaeus", "Rhinolophus hipposideros")
```
4. Which Bat species has the lowest number of roosts across the UK? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

## Honey bee colonies
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/beehive.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

Next we have a file ([honey_bee.tsv](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_j4c0xh/downloads/honey_bee.tsv)) that contains information on the number of Honey Bee colonies in 4 different states. It is temporal data containing information on the 4 quarters for the years 2015-2018.

For more details and even more data please see the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyleahmurphy/nass-honey-bee-20152021

Carry out the below tasks:

1. __Read__ in the file "honey_bee.tsv" as a __data frame__ __variable__ called "bee_colonies_df". Ensure the row names contain the Year info (2015-Q1, 2015-Q2, etc.).
2. Create a __data frame__ called "bee_colonies_2017_2018_df" containing the rows for 2017 & 2018 from "bee_colonies_df". 
3. For each month in 2017 & 2018 print out the phrase "The number of colonies in Minnesota for \<Year> was \<Value>.
    * For example the first phrase will be "The number of colonies in Minnesota for 2017-Q1 was 27000".
    * This can be done with one line of code using the `paste()` function.
4. Make an average (mean) row for "bee_colonies_2017_2018_df".
5. Finally write out the __data frame__ "bee_colonies_2017_2018_df" as a tab separated file called "bee_colonies_2017_2018.tsv".

Now that you have carried that out, attempt the following questions based on the "bee_colonies_2017_2018_df" object.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("Montana", answer="New Mexico", "Pennsylvania")
```
1. Which state has the lowest average? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="Minnesota", "New Mexico", "Pennsylvania")
```
2. Which state has the highest minimum value of colonies? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("Montana", "New Mexico", answer="Pennsylvania")
```
3. Which state had 20,000 colonies in Q3 of 2018 (2018-Q3)? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

__Tip__: If you use the `summary()`, ensure you do not include the "Average" row.

Great! Have a look at the solutions and ask any questions you would like.
