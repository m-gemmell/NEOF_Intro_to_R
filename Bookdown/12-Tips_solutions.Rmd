First ensure you have the "tea_df" loaded (remember your working directory will need to be in the correct location first). Also it needs to be preprocessed with the `gsub()` function.
```{r eval=FALSE}
tea_df <- read.csv("Chapter_10-11/tea_consumption.csv", check.names=FALSE)
tea_df$lb <- tea_df$KG_LB_annual_per_capita
tea_df$lb <- gsub(pattern = ".*_", replacement = "", tea_df$lb)
colnames(tea_df)[3] <- "kg"
tea_df$kg <- gsub(pattern = "_.*", replacement = "", tea_df$kg)
tea_df$kg <- as.numeric(tea_df$kg)
tea_df$lb <- as.numeric(tea_df$lb)
```

Remember there are many ways to carry this out but here is one.

First create a __vector__ with the names of the countries we want:
```{r eval=FALSE}
countries <- c("Ireland", "United Kingdom", "France", "Australia")
```

Set the row names to the countries for easy indexing:

__Note__: Row name must be unique which is the case here.
```{r eval=FALSE}
row.names(tea_df) <- tea_df$Country
```

Create a __data frame__ that only contains our countries of interest. We use the __vector__ as an index for the rows.
```{r eval=FALSE}
tea_df_subset <- tea_df[countries,]
```

Here because we are working with a temporary __variable__ we will overwrite the kg column so the values only contain one decimal place
```{r eval=FALSE}
tea_df_subset$kg <- round(x = tea_df_subset$kg, digits = 1)
```

Last step is to print out the statement. We will use `paste0()` which is exactly like `paste()` but the `sep =` option is set to `""`.
```{r eval=FALSE}
paste0(tea_df_subset$Country, " is the number ", 
       tea_df_subset$Rank, " consumer of tea. It consumes ", 
       tea_df_subset$kg, "kg of tea annually per capita.")
```

## English speakers across the world solution

First make sure the __data frame__ is created. Remember to set your working directory to where the file is.
```{r eval=FALSE}
english_df <- read.csv(
  "Chapter_10-11/english_speaking_population_of_countries.tsv", 
  sep = "\t", 
  row.names = 1,
  check.names = FALSE)
english_df[is.na(english_df)] <- 0
english_complete_datasets_df <- 
  english_df[
    (english_df$`As first language` + english_df$`As an additional language`) ==
      english_df$`Total English speakers`,
    ]
```

Create new __data frame__ only containing countries with an eligible population of > 100 million.
```{r eval=FALSE}
english_100mil_df <- english_complete_datasets_df[
  english_complete_datasets_df$`Eligible population` > 100000000,
  ]
```

Create column with fraction of total english speakers against population
```{r eval=FALSE}
english_100mil_df$`Fraction of population that are English speakers` <- 
  english_100mil_df$`Total English speakers` /
  english_100mil_df$`Eligible population`
```

Create row with mean values
```{r eval=FALSE}
english_100mil_df["Mean",] <- colMeans(english_100mil_df)
```

Create row with totals
```{r eval=FALSE}
english_100mil_df["Total",1:4] <- colSums(english_100mil_df[1:7,1:4])
```

Create the total fraction of english speakers
```{r eval=FALSE}
english_100mil_df["Total","Fraction of population that are English speakers"] <- 
  english_100mil_df["Total","Total English speakers"] /
  english_100mil_df["Total","Eligible population"]
```

__Write__ the data as a file
```{r eval=FALSE}
write.table(x = english_100mil_df, 
            file = "Chapter_10-11/English_top_7_populated_countries.csv", 
            col.names=NA,
            quote = TRUE, 
            sep = ",")
```
