# Handy exercises

There has been a lot covered this session so these exercises will hopefully be straightforward.

Please set the working directory to your main workshop directory and use your "Exercises.R" script. Ensure you are using annotations and code sections to keep the contents clear and separated.

Additionally __read__ in and __write__ out files to "Chapter_10-11" .

## Tea exercise
<center>
![](figures/tea.png){style="width:200px; background:white; border-radius:15px"}
</center>

The first task you will carry out is printing out information from "tea_df". Below is an example statement for the country Turkey:

"Turkey is the number 1 consumer of tea. It consumes 5.8kg of tea annually per capita."

Print out this statement for the countries Ireland, United Kingdom, France, and Australia with their relevant information. Make sure the kilogram value only has one decimal place.

__Tip__: You will require the __functions__ `paste()` and `round()` from day 1.

The last exercise is to create the following table as a __data frame__ called "english_100mil_df". Use the "english_complete_datasets_df" __data frame__ as a start.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'MSc_winter_term_df'}
library("knitr")
library(kableExtra)
english_df <- read.csv("english_speaking_population_of_countries.txt", 
                   sep = "\t", 
                   row.names = 1,
                   check.names = FALSE)
english_df[is.na(english_df)] <- 0
english_complete_datasets_df <- 
  english_df[
    (english_df$`As first language` + english_df$`As an additional language`) ==
      english_df$`Total English speakers`,
    ]
english_100mil_df <- english_complete_datasets_df[english_complete_datasets_df$`Eligible population` > 100000000,]
english_100mil_df$`Fraction of population that are English speakers` <- 
  english_100mil_df$`Total English speakers` /
  english_100mil_df$`Eligible population`
english_100mil_df["Mean",] <- colMeans(english_100mil_df)
english_100mil_df["Total",1:4] <- colSums(english_100mil_df[1:7,1:4])
english_100mil_df["Total","Fraction of population that are English speakers"] <- 
  english_100mil_df["Total","Total English speakers"] /
  english_100mil_df["Total","Eligible population"]

kbl(english_100mil_df) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```


The __data frame__ only contains countries that have an eligible population that is greater than 100 million (100000000). Ensure the "Total" row was not calculated using the "Mean row".

When you have created yours check it with the above one. Is your value for the "Total" "Fraction of population that are English speakers" correct?.

Once you have created the __data frame__ __write__ it out as a comma separated file with the function `write.table()` called "English_top_7_populated_countries.csv". Have the row and column names surrounded by quotes in your file. Make sure there is an empty value above your row names.

## Extra exercise
<center>
![](figures/multiplication.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

If you still have time this session and you do not have any questions please attempt the following task:

Create a multiplication table like the one in the practice from today. However have the row and column names equal one to twelve.

Then __write__ the __data frame__ to a file. The name and format of the file is up to you.

There is no solution to this in the next section.
