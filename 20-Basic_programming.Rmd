# Basic programming {#basicprogramming}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/programming.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
In this chapter we will be look at some basic programming with R. This will involve __loops__, __if__ statements, and creating your own __functions__.

Create and use the directory "Chapter_20-21" as the working directory for this chapter. Additionally create a new script called "Programming.R" for this chapter.

## Recycle rule
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/recycle.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
When two __objects__ of different lengths act upon each other the smaller __object__ will be recycled so each element in the larger __object__ is acted upon.

We will demonstrate this with the below example. Run the command below and then read the explanation.
```{r eval=FALSE}
small_vec <- 1:3
large_vec <- rep(1,9) 
small_vec * large_vec
```

- `small_vec` is a __vector__ with 3 __elements__, the numbers 1 to 3.
- `large_vec` is a __vector__ with 9 __elements__, this is the number 1 repeated 9 times.
- As `small_vec` is 3 times smaller than `large_vec` each __element__ in `small_vec` is recycled 2 times on top of the first usage.
    - The first `small_vec` __element__ is used to multiply the 1st, 4th, and 7th positions of `large_vec`.
    - The second `small_vec` __element__ is used to multiply the 2nd, 5th, and 8th positions of `large_vec`.
    - The last/third `small_vec` __element__ is used to multiply the 3rd, 6th, and 9th positions of `large_vec`.
    
Below is an example with a visualisation. `large_vec` is the numbers 1 to 9 this time:
```{r eval=FALSE}
small_vec <- 1:3
large_vec <- 1:9 
small_vec * large_vec
```

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '80%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/recycle_rule_example_1.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

Depending on the length of the large __vector__ the __elements__ of the smaller __vector__ may be recycled an uneven amount of times. For example:

- The smaller __vector__ has 3 __elements__.
- The larger __vector__ has 4 __elements__.
- The 1st __element__ of the smaller __vector__ would be used twice (recycled once).
- The 2nd & 3rd __elements__ of the smaller __vector__ would be used once (not recycled).

Below is a quick example of this. You should notice a warning is printed out as the length of the __objects__ are not multiples of each other. However, above the warning is the correct output.
```{r eval=FALSE}
1:3 * rep(1,4)
```
 
Warnings usually mean the code will run fine but R thinks you may have done something wrong which you should check. Errors on the other hand mean the R code did not work.
 
Below are a few more examples of using the recycle rule:
```{r eval=FALSE}
#When you multiply one number (scalar) by a numeric vector
#You are recycling the one number (scalar)
2 * 1:6
#Some numeric recycling
1:2 * 1:10
1:4 + 1:8
8:1 - 1:4
2:1 / 1:4
(1:2 + 3:6) * seq(10, 120, 10)
#Strings can be recycled with the paste() function
#You'll notice that no warnings appear this time
#even though the lengths of the variables are not multiples
recyclable_materials <- c("A:aluminium","B:glass","C:paper")
recycle_centres <- rep(
  c("1:old swan","2:otterspool","3:south sefton","4:Huyton","5:Kirkby"),
  2
)
paste0(recyclable_materials, " can be recycled at ", recycle_centres)
```

## Loops
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/loop.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

With __loops__ we can carry out the same commands and __functions__ on multiple __elements__ within a 1 dimensional __object__ (__vector__ or __list__) without having to type it out multiple times.

There are 2 main types of __loops__: __for loops__ and __while loops__.

### For loops
__For loops__ will run through a set of __variables__. Each __variable__ will be run through the set of commands once.

The basic format of a __for loop__ is (don't run the below):
```{r eval=FALSE}
for (variable in vector/list) {
  command/s
}
```

We will run a simple example below. We need the `print()` __function__ so the results are print to the console. If this was not done nothing would be print out as it is a __loop__:
```{r eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i * 10)
}
```

In essence the below was carried out:
```{r eval=FALSE}
loop_vec <- 1:5
i <- loop_vec[1]
print(i * 10)
i <- loop_vec[2]
print(i * 10)
i <- loop_vec[3]
print(i * 10)
i <- loop_vec[4]
print(i * 10)
i <- loop_vec[5]
print(i * 10)
```

Except instead of many lines we were able to carry it out in one command rather than many.

Analogy:

- The loop is a circular assembly line.
- Machines carry out the commands on the provided __variables__.
- A worker will put the first __element__ of the provided __vector/list__ on the assembly, therefore setting it as `i`.
- The machines will carry out the commands on `i`.
- Once the worker gets the 1st set of results they will put the 2nd __element__ on the assembly line, setting it as `i`.
- This will repeat till the results from all the __elements__ are returned.

A few more examples:
```{r eval=FALSE}
for (i in c(3,6,9)) {
  print(i / 3)
  print(i / 2)
}
for (i in c(3,6,9)) {
  print(i %% 3)
  print(i %% 2)
}
#You can have loops in a loop
for (y in 1:5) {
  for (x in 1:6) {
    print(paste0(y, " + ", x, " = ", y+x))
  }
}

#Let us make the fibonacci sequence (first 10 numbers) as a vector
#First we create a vector that contains the number 1 twice
fibo_vec <- c(1,1)
#In a loop we can use the loop variable (i) to index objects
#We can use this for assignment and subsetting
for (i in 3:10) {
  fibo_vec[i] <- fibo_vec[i-1] + fibo_vec[i-2]
}
#Check out the vector
fibo_vec
```

A lot of what we have been doing we could do without __loops__. Where I find __for loops__ handy is when I want to carry out a task on multiple columns or rows.

We can use __for loops__ to quickly create a multiplication table in a matrix.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#First we create a matrix with NA values
#Make sure it contains the number of rows and columns we want
multiplication_mat <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
#Next we create a vector to loop over
loop_vec <-  1:10
#Now to loop through the loop_vec for the columns
for (c in loop_vec) {
  #Next we loop through the loop_vec for the rows
  for (r in loop_vec){
    #Calculate the multiplication
    multiply_number <- c * r
    #Assign the relevant position in the matrix to the multiplication
    multiplication_mat[r,c] <- multiply_number
  }
}
#Check the matrix
multiplication_mat
```

We can then use __for loops__ to carry out specific commands to each column or each row.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#First thing we are going to do is divide each number in the matrix
#By the column total of its column
#We'll save the results in a new matrix called mult_prop_col_mat
#Create the new matrix
mult_prop_col_mat <- multiplication_mat
#Loop through the columns
for (c in 1:ncol(mult_prop_col_mat)) {
  #Calculate column total
  column_total <- sum(mult_prop_col_mat[,c])
  #Assign calculated proportion vector to the column
  mult_prop_col_mat[,c] <- mult_prop_col_mat[,c] / column_total
}
#check new matrix
mult_prop_col_mat

#We'll do the same again but for each row
#This time with no annotation
mult_prop_row_mat <- multiplication_mat
for (r in 1:nrow(mult_prop_row_mat)) {
  mult_prop_row_mat[r,] <- 
    mult_prop_row_mat[r,] / 
    sum(mult_prop_row_mat[r,])
}
mult_prop_row_mat
```

Hopefully this is clear how __for loops__ can be used. Further down we'll work with a real dataset to show some real world applications. However, for now we will go onto __while loops__.

### While loops
I do not use __while loops__ often so we will only briefly go over them. A __while loop__ will loop over a series of commands until a condition is no longer met. Conditions will either be TRUE or FALSE (logical)

The format of a __while loop__:
```{r eval=FALSE}
while (condition) {
  command/s
}
```

Below is an example:
```{r eval=FALSE}
i <- 1
while (i < 10) {
  print(paste0(
    "At the start of loop number:", i, ", the variable i is ", i))
  i <- i + 1
  print(paste0("-----"))
}
i
```

In this case 1 is being added to `i` in each loop. The loop keeps going till `i` is no longer less than 10. Therefore, at the end of the __while loop__ `i` is equal to 10.

One final point on __while loops__. You can make a __while loop__ so the condition will always be met. If this is the case the __while loop__ will never finish and you'll need to use "ESC" in the console to stop the __while loop__. An example is below which you should not run:
```{r eval=FALSE}
i <- 1
while (i > 0) {
  print(paste0(
    "At the start of loop number:", i, ", the variable i is ", i))
  i <- i + 1
  print(paste0("-----"))
}
i
```

## If statements
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/flow_chart.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
__If statements__ allow for different commands to be carried out depending on __if__ a condition is met. 

This can be thought of like a flow chart where you go one way if you answer yes and another if you answer no. Example:

- Are you thirsty?
- If yes, have something to drink.
- If no, do not have something to drink.

Basic format of an __if equation__:
```{r eval=FALSE}
if (condition) {
  command/s if condition true
} else {
  command/s if condition false
}
```

I'll show you a coding example using the modulus (`%%`) __operator__.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create a scalar
i <- 3
#If statement determing if the remainder of i/2 is 1
if (( i %% 2) == 1) {
  paste0(i, " is odd")
} else {
  paste0(i, " is even")
}
```

You can have an __if statement__ within a __loop__.

__Reminder__: We need to use `print()` within __loops__ to print results to the console.
```{r eval=FALSE}
for (i in 0:9) {
  #If statement determining if the remainder of i/2 is 1
  if (( i %% 2) == 1) {
    print(paste0(i, " is odd"))
  } else {
    print(paste0(i, " is even"))
  }
}
```

##  Functions
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/custon_function.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
Throughout this course we have used many __functions__. However, you may want a __function__ that does not exist. In this case you can create your own.

The format to create your own __function__ is:
```{r eval=FALSE}
function_name <- function(inputs_and_option_names){
  command/s
  return(new_variable)
}
```

There are 2 new __functions__ above:

- `function()`: This __function__ creates the new __function__.
- `return()`: This specifies what will be returned when we run our new __function__.

A quick example to add VAT to each number in a __vector__:
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create the function
add_vat <- function(input_num_vec) {
  vat_vec <- input_num_vec * 1.2
  return(round(vat_vec, digits = 2))
}
#Example running the new function
add_vat(0.99)
add_vat(c(9.99, 8.78, 2.45))
```

In the below example we will create a __function__ that will __return__ all numbers that are multiples of 5 from the input __vector__.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create the function
all_mult_5_func <- function(input_num_vec){
  #Create an empty vector prior to loop to contain multiples of 5
  out_vec <- vector(mode="numeric", length=0)
  #Loop to add multiples of 5 to out_vec
  for (i in input_num_vec){
    #If statement so only multiples of 5 are added to the out_vec
    #In this case no else part is required
    if ((i %% 5) == 0 ){
      out_vec <- c(out_vec, i)
    }
  }
  #Have the return function at the very end
  return(out_vec)
}
#Try out the function with some vectors
all_mult_5_func(1:20)
all_mult_5_func(seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 8))
all_mult_5_func(1:10 * 5)
```

Like with normal __functions__ a custom one can be given multiple arguments if built that way. Knowing this we will alter the above __function__ so it can __return__ all numbers that are multiples of a chosen number.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#When creating the function add in another input/option name
all_mult_x_func <- function(input_num_vec, multiple){
  #Create an empty vector prior to loop to contain the multiples
  out_vec <- vector(mode="numeric", length=0)
  #Loop to add the multiples to out_vec
  for (i in input_num_vec){
    #If statement so only multiples of the chosen number are added to the out_vec
    #In this case no else part is required
    if ((i %% multiple) == 0 ){
      out_vec <- c(out_vec, i)
    }
  }
  #Have the return function at the very end
  return(out_vec)
}
#Try out the function with some vectors
all_mult_x_func(input_num_vec = 1:20, multiple = 2)
all_mult_x_func(seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 8), 4)
all_mult_x_func(1:10 * 5, 10)
#As always we can assign the output of a function to a new variable
multiples_of_6_btwn_1_100 <- all_mult_x_func(1:100, 6)
```

With all that we are now going to a real dataset in the next session to show the use and applications of these new techniques.
