# Basic stats
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/basic_stats.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

This week we'll learn how to carry out some basic stats. This will involve linear regressions and some t-tests.

Create and use the directory "Chapter_17-18" as the working directory for this chapter. Additionally create a new script called "Stats.R" for this chapter.

Before we continue just a reminder about [annotations](#annotations) and [code sections](#codesections).

## Linear regression
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/linear_regression.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
Linear regression is a method to model the relationship between two __numeric vectors__. Ultimately we want to produce the predictive equation:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

Where _m_ is equal to the gradient and _c_ is equal to the intercept. With this we can predict the value of _y_ if we know the value of _x_ and vice versa.

### Fish market dataset
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '30%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/bream.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
Before getting to the analysis we need to read in the data. For this chapter we will be looking at the file [Fish.csv](https://cgr.liv.ac.uk/illum/NEOFworkshops_5bfa93ca0482d69d/Intro_to_R/data/Fish.csv) which contains information of 7 common fish species sold in Fish markets (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market).

The columns for the data are:

- __Species__: Species of fish ("Bream", "Roach", "Whitefish",
"Parkki", "Perch", "Pike", and "Smelt").
- __Weight__: Weight of the fish in grams.
- __Length1__: Vertical length of the fish in centimetres.
- __Length2__: Diagonal length of the fish in centimetres.
- __Length3__: Cross length of the fish in centimetres.
- __Height__: Height of the fish in centimetres.
- __Width__: Diagonal width of the fish in centimetres.

The dataset is primarily interested in predicting the weight of a fish based on its length, height, or width.

First step is to __read__ in the data:
```{r eval=FALSE}
fish_df <- read.csv("Fish.csv", check.names = FALSE)
```

Have a look at the __data frame__ and you'll see it looks pretty good with no `NA` values.

For now we only want to look at the information for the species Bream. Let's create a "bream_df":
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create the data frame
bream_df <- fish_df[fish_df$Species == "Bream",]
#Check how many rows it has
nrow(bream_df)
```

We are left with 35 data points which should be plenty for our linear regression.

### Scatterplot
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Scatterplot_2.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
Before we carry out the linear regression we'll create a scatterplot of the two __vectors__ we want to compare. For the first instance we will compare __Height__ to __Length1__ (vertical length).

In fact before we do, let's change the column name "Length1" to "v_length" so it is a bit more intuitive for us. Whilst we are at it we'll change the other length column names.
```{r eval=FALSE}
colnames(bream_df)[3:5] <- c("v_length", "d_length", "c_length")
```

Time to quickly plot "v_length" (x) against "Weight" (y):
```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(x = bream_df$v_length, y = bream_df$Weight)
```

Super! That looks like a decently linear plot with a positive trend. We will therefore fit the linear model.

### Linear model
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/lm.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
We can fit a linear model with the __function__ `lm()`. We simply provide the column names as a formula ( `y_column_name ~ x_column_name` ) similar to the `boxplot()` __function__.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fit <- lm(Weight~v_length, data=bream_df)
```

We can now add the linear model as a line to our plot with the __function__ `abline()`
```{r eval=FALSE}
abline(fit)
```

With the line added we also want to add the linear equation to the plot. To do this we need to check the contents of the "fit" __variable__ first so we know what to add.
```{r eval=FALSE}
fit
```

You'll see the following two sections:

- `Call:` Shows the __function__ with options you ran to create "fit"
- `Coefficients:`: This contains 2 parts
    - `(Intercept)`: This is the intercept value of the linear model (_c_)
    - `v_length`: This is the gradient values (_m_)

Our next step is to create a __string scalar__ containing the linear equation. To do this we can extract the coefficients from the "fit" __object__ like below:
```{r eval=FALSE}
m <- fit$coefficients[2]
c <- fit$coefficients[1]
```

If you print out "m" and "c" to the console you'll notice they have a different number of decimal places than when displayed through printing "fit". We will therefore change these to 2 decimal places with the `round()` __function__:
```{r eval=FALSE}
m <- round(m, digits = 2)
c <- round(c, digits = 2)
```

Now to use the `paste0()` __function__ to create our linear equation as a __string scalar__:
```{r eval=FALSE}
linear_equation <- paste0("y = ", m , "x + ", c)
```

Finally we will recreate our plot, add the abline, and then add the linear equation. We will add the linear equation with the __function__ `text()`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(x = bream_df$v_length, y = bream_df$Weight)
abline(fit)
text(x = 30, y = 800, labels = linear_equation)
```

The `text()` options `x = ` and `y =` normally require a bit of trial and error to set it in a nice location. This can be a bit fiddly but is made much easier by making the label smaller (e.g. making the numbers have a smaller amount of decimal places).

## t-test
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/scale.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
A t-test can be used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.

In this example we will compare the weights of the fish Bream, Parkki, and Roach. Therefore let's subset our __data frame__ so we have three __data frames__, one for each species.

We already have a "bream_df" so we only need to make one for Parkki and one for Roach. Before we do we'll change the column names for "fish_df" like we did for "bream_df"
```{r eval=FALSE}
colnames(fish_df)[3:5] <- c("v_length", "d_length", "c_length")
parkki_df <- fish_df[fish_df$Species == "Parkki",]
roach_df <- fish_df[fish_df$Species == "Roach",]
```

### Boxplot
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/boxplot.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
Before carrying out a t-test it can be useful to visualise the difference between groups with a boxplot.

Before we do this we need to combine the three __data frames__ into one. This can be done by binding the rows with `rbind()`. This will combine two provided __data frames__ which contain the same number of columns with the same column names.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Combine bream_df and parkki_df
fish_subset_df <- rbind(bream_df, parkki_df)
#Now rbind roach_df to our new df
fish_subset_df <- rbind(fish_subset_df, roach_df)
```

There is also `cbind` to combine __data frames__ by columns. In this case the __data frames__ need to have the same number of rows with the same order and names.

Time for a boxplot!
```{r eval=FALSE}
boxplot(Weight~Species, data = fish_subset_df)
```

We can clearly see that the weights of Parkki and Roach are very similar to each other but very different to Bream's weight.

### t-test comparison
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/five_percent.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
Let us see if what we see visually is also visible statistically.

We can carry out a t-test with the __function__ `t.test()`. Simply provide the __function__ with the two __numerical vectors__ you would like to compare.
```{r eval=FALSE}
bream_parkki_ttest <- t.test(bream_df$Weight, parkki_df$Weight)
bream_roach_ttest <- t.test(bream_df$Weight, roach_df$Weight)
parkki_roach_ttest <- t.test(parkki_df$Weight, roach_df$Weight)
```

Print the resulting __variables__ to the console and you will see a lot of information. I am sure all these values can say a lot about the data but we are only interested in the p-values.

In this case we can say the means between the two groups tested are significantly different if the p-value is less than 0.05 (1 in 20).

It can be a bit annoying to have to look through the `t.test()` output for each result so we'll create a __vector__ to contain the p-values for comparisons against Bream.
```{r eval=FALSE}
fish_species_weight_ttests <- c(
  bream_parkki_ttest$p.value,
  bream_roach_ttest$p.value
)
```

This is pretty useful but we can't immediately see which comparison each t-test is equal to. Thankfully just like __data frames__ have row and column names, __vectors__ can have names for each element.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Add the vector names
names(fish_species_weight_ttests) <- 
  c("bream_vs_parkki","bream_vs_roach")
#Look at the vector with the added names
fish_species_weight_ttests
```

We can then index the __vector__ through the names.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Access the p-value of Bream against Roach
fish_species_weight_ttests["bream_vs_roach"]
#Add the p-value of Parkki against Roach
fish_species_weight_ttests["parkki_vs_roach"] <- 
  parkki_roach_ttest$p.value
```

With our nice __vector__ of p-values we can quickly see where the p-value is less than 0.05 (i.e. the means are significantly different) and where it is higher (i.e. the means aren't significantly different).
```{r eval=FALSE}
fish_species_weight_ttests < 0.05
```

Do these p-values match what you saw in the boxplot?

## Some more useful functions
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/r_toolbox.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

### Summary
The __function__ `summary()` can give you some quick summary information for each column of a __data frame__.

```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(fish_df)
```

This gives you some nice information for your numerical columns:

- `Min.`: The minimum number
- `1st Qu.`: The 25th quartile
- `Median`: The median (Middle sorted number)
- `Mean`: The average
- `3rd Qu.`: The 75th quartile
- `Max.`: The maximum number 

You will notice the information given for the "Species" column is not very informative as it is a __character__ column. However, this would be a lot more descriptive if it was a __factor__.

Therefore we'll change the "Species" column to a __factor__ and run `summary()` again.
```{r eval=FALSE}
fish_df$Species <- as.factor(fish_df$Species)
summary(fish_df)
```

Now `summary()` shows how many instances of each species is present in the __data frame__.

For future cases it may better to use `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` with the `read.csv()` __function__ when we first read in the file.

### Table
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/table_ikea.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
The `table()` __function__ will provide a __vector__ containing the number of instances for each __level__ in a __factor__. This is pretty much what `summary()` did to a __factor__.

However, unlike `summary()` it will also do this for __characters__ and __numerics__.

__Note__: Remember to use the __"Help"__ pane if you are not sure what a __function__ does.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Table command for columns from fish_df
table(fish_df$Species)
table(as.character(fish_df$Species))
table(fish_df$Height)
table(floor(fish_df$Height))
table(as.integer(fish_df$Height))
#Run table on various numeric vectors
table(1:10)
table(1:100 * 0)
table(1:100 %% 2)
table(seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 0.5) %% 7.5)
table(c(1:9,1:8,1:7,1:6,1:5,1:4,1:3,1:2,1))
#Table will run on logicals too
table(1:100 > 50)
table(c("a","a","b","c") == "a")
#Create a vector of 20 random numbers between 0 and 10
random_num_vec <- sample(0:10, size = 20, replace = TRUE )
#table
table(random_num_vec)
#Create a character vector randomly containing 1-10 of the strings
#"Book", "TV", and "Film" each
random_char_vec <- c(
  rep("Book", sample(1:10, size = 1)),
  rep("TV", sample(1:10, size = 1)),
  rep("Film", sample(1:10, size = 1))
)
#Now for table()
table(random_char_vec)
#Can create a quick bar plot with the output from table()
barplot(table(random_char_vec))
```

A few more __functions__ were introduced above. I will let you explore them yourself or you can ask me verbally.
