## World happiness report solutions
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/world_happiness_solutions.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
1. Read in the file
```{r eval=TRUE}
happy_df <- read.csv("Chapter_17-18/world_happiness_report_2016.csv", 
                      check.names = FALSE,
                      stringsAsFactors = TRUE,
                      sep = ","
                      )
```

2. Answer the following questions using the output from one __function__:
```{r eval=TRUE}
summary(happy_df)
```
- How many countries are in the region "Western Europe"?
    + __21__
- What is the maximum number in the "Happiness Score" column?
    + __7.526__
- From the columns "Economy (GDP per Capital)" to "Dystopia Residual", which has the highest mean and which has the lowest?
    + __Highest: "Dystopia Residual" with 2.3258__
    + __Lowest: "Trust (Government Corruption)" with 0.13762__

3.Produce the plot
```{r eval=TRUE, fig.width= 8, fig.height=8}
#Fit linear model of Economy (x) against Family (y)
fit_economy_family <- 
  lm(Family~`Economy (GDP per Capita)`, data = happy_df)
#Create string for linear equation
c <- round(fit_economy_family$coefficients[1], digits = 4)
m <- round(fit_economy_family$coefficients[2], digits = 4)
lm_equation <- paste0("y = ", m , "x + ", c)
#Produce plot
plot(x = happy_df$`Economy (GDP per Capita)`,
     y = happy_df$Family,
     main = "Comparison of the effect of \n Economy and Family on happiness",
     xlab = "Economy (GDP per Capita)",
     ylab = "Family",
     pch = as.numeric(happy_df$Region),
     xlim = c(0,2), ylim = c(0,1.5),
     col = 1)
#Add abline
abline(fit_economy_family, col = "mediumslateblue")
#Add equation to top right
text(x = 0.4, y = 1.1, labels = lm_equation)
#Add the legend
legend(x = "bottomright",
       pch = 1:nlevels(happy_df$Region),
       legend = levels(happy_df$Region))
```

4. Save plot as png file
```{r eval=FALSE}
#PNG command
png(filename = "Chapter_17-18/Economy_vs_family.png", 
    units = "in", height = 8, width = 8, res = 200)
#Produce plot
plot(x = happy_df$`Economy (GDP per Capita)`,
     y = happy_df$Family,
     main = "Comparison of the effect of \n Economy and Family on happiness",
     xlab = "Economy (GDP per Capita)",
     ylab = "Family",
     pch = as.numeric(happy_df$Region),
     xlim = c(0,2), ylim = c(0,1.5),
     col = 1)
#Add abline
abline(fit_economy_family, col = "mediumslateblue")
#Add equation to top right
text(x = 0.4, y = 1.1, labels = lm_equation)
#Add the legend
legend(x = "bottomright",
       pch = 1:nlevels(happy_df$Region),
       legend = levels(happy_df$Region))
#dev.off
dev.off()
```

5. Answers for the following questions:
- Does the linear model have a positive or negative gradient?
    + __Positive__ (m = 0.4328)
- Which variable (Economy or Family) has higher values?
    + __Economy__
- If the value of Economy was 2.1 what would be the predictive value of Family according to the linear model equation?
    + __(0.4328*2.1) + 0.3808 = 1.28968__
- Which region appears to have the highest values for Economy and for Family?
    + __Western Europe__

6. Produce boxplot
```{r eval=TRUE, fig.width= 16, fig.height=10}
#Change level names
short_region_names <- 
  c("OZ_n_NZ", "C_n_E_Europe", "E_Asia", "Latin_A_n_Carib",
    "ME_n_N_Africa", "N_America", "SE_Asia", "S_Asia",
    "Sub_Saharan", "W_Europe")
levels(happy_df$Region) <- short_region_names
#Create boxplot
boxplot(`Happiness Score`~Region, data = happy_df, 
        ylim = c(0,10),
        col = 1:nlevels(happy_df$Region),
        main = "Happiness scores across regions"
)
```

7. Save as jpeg
```{r eval=FALSE}
#jpeg
jpeg(filename = "Chapter_17-18/Region_happiness_boxplots.jpg", units = "px",
     width = 1600, height = 750 )
#Create boxplot
boxplot(`Happiness Score`~Region, data = happy_df, 
        ylim = c(0,10),
        col = 1:nlevels(happy_df$Region),
        main = "Happiness scores across regions"
)
#dev.off
dev.off()
```

8. T-tests
```{r eval=TRUE}
#Subset the data frames to get vectors of our regions of interest
WE_happiness <- happy_df[happy_df$Region == "W_Europe","Happiness Score"]
NA_happiness <- happy_df[happy_df$Region == "N_America","Happiness Score"] 
SA_happiness <- happy_df[happy_df$Region == "S_Asia","Happiness Score"] 
SEA_happiness <- happy_df[happy_df$Region == "SE_Asia","Happiness Score"]
#Carry out t-tests
WE_NA_ttest <- t.test(WE_happiness, NA_happiness)
WE_SA_ttest <- t.test(WE_happiness, SA_happiness)
SA_SEA_ttest <- t.test(SA_happiness, SEA_happiness)
#Extract p values into a new vector with element names
region_happiness_pvalues <- c(WE_NA = WE_NA_ttest$p.value,
                              WE_SA = WE_SA_ttest$p.value,
                              SA_SEA = SA_SEA_ttest$p.value)
#Logical to determine if the p-value is less than 0.05
#I.e. the means are significantly different
region_happiness_pvalues < 0.05
```
